# Atkin-s-sieve
The main idea of the algorithm is to use irreducible quadratic forms (representing numbers as ax2 + by2). 
The previous algorithms were basically various modifications of the sieve of Eratosthenes,
which used the representation of numbers in the form of reduced forms (usually in the form of a product of xy).
